						Hello, My name is Joshua Hodkinson, and I use this site to share and communicate my progress as a student game programmer. I will post games I make, code snippets I have written, tools I have designed and anything else I deem relevant or useful on my journey. I am fluent writing in C#, confident in C++ and D. Recently I have also learnt python and django which I used to build this site. I am very comfortable working in Unity but otherwise don't try to limit myself to any particular development environment. My aim is to make other people's jobs easier, the tools that I use to achieve this matter less than the time I save those people. I am happy to give any problem a go and welcome any feedback that will help me become a better programmer.
