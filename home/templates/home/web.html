			<p style="font-size:larger">Versatiltiy is a great tool for a programmer this holds especially true when selecting a language to solve a problem. Not every lanaguage is suited to every problem so I make an effort to familiarize myself with as many areas as possible. One such area is web development; the internet is an integarl part of today's soceity so it becomes important for a programmer to be at least passingly acquainted with full stack development. Here you can find some of the web projects I have worked on.</p>
